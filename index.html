    <li class="lmn">After coming this far you might be curious about knowing my name so let me introduce myself. My name is Kritarth Rai and I am from Deoria, Uttar Pradesh. The journey to this institute has been through many hardships and still many are there on their way.</li>
    <li class="lmn">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write, I like to think, I like to dr eam, I like to talk, I like to listen. Oneâ€™s future can be determined by what one has achieved today or what one is doing today.</li>
    <li class="lmn">A man who dreams only for future and does nothing for tomorrow can be best named as lazy and pathetic. In that way, I dislike myself being called as a man without a vision and castle maker in sky.Therefore, writing about myself, I m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life is the total manifestation of what I do today. I try myself to be humble, passionate, dedicated, hardworking and honest.</li>
    <li class="lmn">I deem my parents as being my best mentors. I have learnt the real meaning and worth of life from my parents. I am with a happy, focused and hardworking family. That is definitely the greatest blessing of God for me.</li>
